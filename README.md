# spoofspy

Experimental app for detecting and displaying spoofed/redirect servers on Steam.

Supported games: Rising Storm 2: Vietnam.

## TODO

- Import `_version.py` to make it available in releases.
    - Actually, consider if we want to do this? There seem to
      be many opinions on whether having a __version__ attribute
      is the right way to do it.
